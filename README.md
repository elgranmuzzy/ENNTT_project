# ENNTT project
A HSE course on Computational linguistics project.

This Jupyter Notebook uses data from the repository: https://github.com/senisioi/enntt-release

Put the unzipped data files to ./ENNTT folder to load.

Warning: the Stanza processing part is computationally intensive. A CUDA-powered environment is highly recommended (Google Colab).
